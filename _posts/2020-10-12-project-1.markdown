In Romania, over 1 million students begin a bachelorâ€™s program every year, but unfortunately about a third of them quit their studies during the first year. Not choosing the most appropriate study area for them seems to be the cause of this situation.
Many of them also complain about the fact that the university brochures they have access to before studying, picture a very different image of the university life compared to what they experience when they begin it. Other reported reasons is the lack of information, or that the educational standards are below their expectations.
