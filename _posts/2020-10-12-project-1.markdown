description: Problem description<br>
In Romania, over 1 million students begin a bachelor’s program every year, but unfortunately about a third of them quit their studies during the<br> first year. Not choosing the most appropriate study area for them seems to be the cause of this situation.<br>
Many of them also complain about the fact that the university brochures they have access to before studying, picture a very different image of<br> the university life compared to what they experience when they begin it. Other reported reasons is the lack of information, or that the educational<br> standards are below their expectations.<br>
<br>
Solution<br>
By creating a digital platform (mobile application) where students can leave testimonials and reviews about the study programs they are currently<br> enrolled in we believe we can create a realistic image about what the future students should expect. The platform will contain<br> a Q&A section where everybody can ask questions and verified users can answer them.<br>
<br>
Customer segments<br>
High school students and persons who want to start a bachelor’s degree program.<br>
